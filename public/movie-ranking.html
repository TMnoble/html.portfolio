<h1>The Best Movies According To Noble</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Blacklist</h3>
<P>Undoubtedly one of the best series of the last decade. The whole series is escapism at its finest and worth a look.</P>
<h3>The Originals</h3>
<p>A great show about family while being a testament to the endurance of familial love.</p>
<h3>Pirates of the caribbean</h3>
<p>It's such a sweeping action-adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas.</p>
